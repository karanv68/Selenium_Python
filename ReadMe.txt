This is a Introduction of using Selenium with Python
 
I am assuming you know how to code in Python atleast Basic :)

# Prerequistites 

** Its upto you which IDE you want to work on ? Pycharm: VS Code : eclipse

1. Python should be installed in your PC
    You can check the installed packages by running in the terminal {pip list} 
2. Install required modules like
    2.1 {Pip install Selenium}

3. Install any browser extension either Chrome/Edge/Firefox/opera, available online
   Make sure you place the extension under the scripts folder where python is installed.
   After that there might be a possibility you need to add the scripts folder path in to the environment path.
4. Install the extension according to the version of your browser, I am installing Chrome extension
    and check your version here {chrome://settings/help} 


The best way to learn it is going through the documentation available online
